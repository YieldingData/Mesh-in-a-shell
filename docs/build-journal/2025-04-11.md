## Overview
Today’s focus was on getting the basic hardware set up and verifying that the ESP32-S3 can run our test firmware. The goals were to verify that all hardware components are on hand, flash a simple “Hello World” firmware to the ESP32-S3, hook up the e-paper screen, and display a basic test message.

## Goals for Today
- **Hardware Check:**  
  - Ensure all components (ESP32-S3, e-paper display, cables, etc.) are available and properly connected.
  
- **Flash Test Firmware:**  
  - Compile and flash a simple test firmware onto the ESP32-S3.
  
- **Display Setup:**  
  - Connect the e-paper screen and confirm it initializes correctly.
  
- **Output a Test Message:**  
  - Get a basic message (e.g., “Hello Mesh”) to display on the screen.

## Progress & Observations
- **Hardware:**  
  - All necessary components have been located and are ready for assembly.
  
- **Firmware Flash:**  
  - Successfully flashed a basic firmware to the ESP32-S3.
  - Serial monitor shows that the device boots and enters the main loop.
  
- **Display Module:**  
  - The e-paper display is hooked up.
  - The “Display Ready” message is visible, confirming initialization.
  
- **Test Message:**  
  - A static test message (“Hello Mesh”) was successfully rendered on the screen.
  
## Next Steps
- Fine-tune the display refresh to ensure clarity.
- Begin integrating the next module (e.g., GPS or button inputs) once the basic display test is stable.
- Document any challenges encountered and update wiring diagrams as needed.
