# 2025-04-11 – Daily Build Log

## Overview
Today marks the first active build log entry for Mesh in a Shell. Today we’re kicking off with initial tests and setup activities. This entry documents the steps taken to verify our project structure and the early functionality of key modules.

## Goals for Today
- **Repository Structure:**  
  - Finalize the core folder layout (including `display/`, `gps/`, `picom/`, `powerman/`, and `ui/`).
  - Ensure the master `BUILD_LOG.md` references this and other daily logs correctly.
  
- **Firmware Initialization:**  
  - Compile and upload a basic firmware sketch to the ESP32-S3.
  - Print debug messages to the serial monitor for verification.

- **Display Testing:**  
  - Initialize the display module.
  - Render a “Display Ready” message on the e-paper screen.

- **GPS Module Preliminary Check:**  
  - Power up the GPS module and validate its initial startup (note: actual parsing of a GPS fix will be refined later).

- **Basic Communication Framework:**  
  - Prepare the initial setup for the PiCom module (simulate sending a test JSON packet).

## Progress & Observations
- **Repository Structure:**  
  - All required folders have been created:
    - `docs/build-journal/` (for daily logs)
    - Firmware folders under `/firmware/esp32s3/` (including `display/`, `gps/`, `picom/`, `powerman/`, and `ui/`).
  
- **Firmware Setup:**  
  - A base firmware has been compiled and successfully uploaded to the ESP32-S3.
  - Debug outputs confirm the device boots and enters the main loop.

- **Display Module:**  
  - The e-paper successfully displays the “Display Ready” message.
  - Initial tests show clear text with no major refresh issues.

- **GPS Module:**  
  - The module is powering on.
  - No fix has been confirmed yet; further testing is required to simulate or acquire satellite data.

- **PiCom Module:**  
  - Placeholder logic is in place to simulate communication.
  - A test JSON packet was output to the serial monitor.

## Next Steps
- Refine the GPS module to reliably parse and output a fix.
- Integrate physical button input to switch between UI states.
- Build out the full PiCom communication routine with simulated Orange Pi interaction.
- Begin working on LoRa messaging integration.
- Address minor issues, such as debouncing for buttons, in upcoming iterations.
