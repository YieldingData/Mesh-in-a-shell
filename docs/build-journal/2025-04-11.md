# 2025-04-11 – Project Management Build Log

## Overview
Today’s session was dedicated entirely to project management. I focused on reviewing our current Gantt chart, refining the milestones, and setting clear future goals for Mesh in a Shell. This step ensures that the project remains well-organized and that each 30-minute session is purposeful.

## Goals for Today
- **Review & Refine Gantt Chart:**  
  - Examine current tasks and dependencies.
  - Adjust session counts for tasks that appear under- or over-estimated.
- **Set Future Goals & Milestones:**  
  - Define advanced features such as MeshCore integration, the Web Flasher, and full system testing.
  - Identify any new risks or dependencies.
- **Document Action Items:**  
  - Update the project timeline in the repository.
  - Create a list of next steps to guide upcoming sessions.

## Progress & Observations
- **Gantt Chart Review:**  
  - The current Gantt chart is a solid foundation, breaking tasks into 30-minute sessions.
  - Some module integrations (e.g., UI, GPS parsing) might require additional time than initially estimated.
  - Future milestones were identified, including final system testing and the advanced feature integrations.
  
- **Future Goals Set:**  
  - Establish milestones for MeshCore integration and the auto-flasher.
  - Plan for iterative improvements in firmware modules.
  - Consider enhancements like an automated Build Log update (via GitHub Actions).
  
- **Action Items:**  
  - Revise the Gantt chart with updated session estimates and task dependencies.
  - Update project documentation (README and wiki) to reflect the revised timeline.
  - Prepare a detailed task list for the next phase of firmware module integrations.

## Next Steps
- **Update Gantt Chart:** Incorporate today's feedback and share the updated version in the project docs.
- **Refine Module Roadmaps:** Begin drafting more detailed plans for UI and communication modules.
- **Document in GitHub:** Ensure that these updates are reflected in our GitHub wiki and commit the changes.
