# UI â€“ User Interface Module

This module manages the high-level user interface states and transitions on the ESP32-S3 device. It coordinates the display output, touch input (if available), and button responses to navigate between screens and provide feedback.

## Purpose

- Maintain a state machine for UI navigation
- Render key screens:
  - Boot screen
  - Message received
  - Menu with options
  - Mini-game (during boot delay)
- Handle button/touch events
- Interface with display module and system state
