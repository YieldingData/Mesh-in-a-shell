# Vibe – Visual + Audio Identity

This folder contains the visual, thematic, and UI elements that define the look and feel of **Mesh in a Shell**. Inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics, particularly *Ghost in the Shell*, this space is for experimenting with icons, animations, fonts, sound cues, and any other sensory details that give the project its atmosphere.

---

## Purpose

- Collect and curate the **visual and emotional tone** of the device
- Create **loading screens**, **menu animations**, and **status icons**
- Align all assets with the theme of **low-power, high-purpose cyberpunk tools**
- Develop **immersive feedback** that makes each interaction feel part of a larger system

---

## Inspirations

- **Ghost in the Shell** (film + anime aesthetic)
- Retro-futuristic UI elements
- Modular interfaces and tactical feedback
- Smooth e-paper transitions with a "tech-y" pause

---

## Ideas for Assets

### Visual

- Loading animations (e.g., “SYNCHRONIZING NODE…”)
- Glitch overlays or scan lines
- Battery and signal icons
- Text banners for message status (DELIVERED, RELAYED, FAILED)

### Fonts / Text

- All-caps monospace or semi-serif futuristic
- Simple Japanese or ASCII glyphs mixed with English
- Subtle data rain / terminal UI mimicry

### Audio (Optional)

- Power-up / sync tone
- Message send/receive blips
- Optional voice lines ("Connection secured", "Message relayed")
